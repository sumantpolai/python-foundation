# Python Foundation

This repository is part of my transition from Frontend Developer to
High-Level Python Engineer and Applied Data Scientist.

## Objectives
- Master Python fundamentals and internals
- Write clean, readable, and testable Python code
- Understand how Python differs from JavaScript at runtime and design level

## Topics Covered
- Python data types and mutability
- Functions and arguments handling
- Core collections and their use cases
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Basic unit testing using pytest

## Learning Philosophy
I focus on understanding *why* something works, not just *how* to use it.
Each module contains explanations and examples written by me.

## Status
🚧 In Progress
